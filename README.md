# Farkle: A dice game by Gabe Freiman
# This is a primarily object-oriented algorithm that simulates a complete game of Farkle. Its the result of a short project I did during spare time in Summer 2020. More about the game rules can be read in the documentation of the script file. As of 7/28/20 it is mostly complete. The only things I plan to add are excpetions when user input is bad and some comments explaining the code decisions.
